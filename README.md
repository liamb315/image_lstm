# Description
LSTM architecture to evaluate sequences of images based off the Oxford LSTM Tutorial [practical 1 repository](https://github.com/oxford-cs-ml-2015/practical1).

# TODO
1.  Test the new hidden-layer input representation
  a.  Replicate the new text file, hidden_layer_output.txt, for all properties in R and output as csv to data directory
  b.  Convert the csv file into a Torch Tensor
  c.  Run the LSTM architecture
    * New rnn_size
    * New input_size
    * New csv files


# Questions
1.  Representation is sparse at the hidden layer FC7, concerning?
