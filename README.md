# Description
LSTM architecture to evaluate sequences of images based off the Oxford LSTM Tutorial [practical 1 repository](https://github.com/oxford-cs-ml-2015/practical1).

# Code Base
There are two basic Lua functions, one for training `train_lstm.lua` and one for testing the performance of the model `test_lstm.lua`  

## Preprocessing 


## Training the LSTM Architecture
From the appropriate environment, one can call them from the command line

```
th train.lua
```

# Questions
1.  Representation is sparse at the hidden layer FC7, concerning?
